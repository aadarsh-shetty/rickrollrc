# rickrollrc

Special thanks to [serene](https://github.com/keroserene) and [Frank Bi](https://github.com/frankbi) for their original work, which served as a major inspiration.

Zsh script which [rickrolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) your
terminal by playing Rick Astley‚Äôs ‚ÄúNever Gonna Give You Up‚Äù with ANSI 256-color
coded UTF-8 characters + audio

## How to Roll
To start rickrollin‚Äô immediately:

    curl -# -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aadarsh-shetty/rickrollrc/master/roll.sh | zsh

Here is the clandestine command you can give to your friends üòà

    curl -# -L https://bit.ly/4cCuqBG | zsh

For the record: It is not actually a good idea to make a habit of

    curl $(random_script_from_the_internets) | zsh

For a salutary lesson in the importance of taking care what you
execute in your terminal, inspired by the classic [Steam Locomotive](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl)

## Misc.
This has been tested on MacOS Sonoma 14.5.

Since this is a colorful hobby, you need to ensure 256-color mode is enabled or
Astley will look sad. Kudos to jart for our lovely hiptext shenanigans. [Hiptext](https://github.com/jart/hiptext), which
generates ANSI color codes for any image or video.
